RabbitMQ
RABBIT MQ
•	RabbitMQ is a Messaging Broker.
•	RabbitMQ implements AMQP.
•	AMQP stands for Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol.
 
AMQP
•	AMQP Standardizes messaging, using Producers, Consumers, Brokers.
•	Advantage of Messaging Queue is that it increases loose coupling and scalability.


How AMQP Works	

AMQP will have Producers and Consumers.
Producers and Consumers will communicate through Queue.
Producer will not send the messages directly to the Queue instead it will use the exchange.
Producers will send the messages to exchange and exchange will later forwards it to queue.

Exchange will make sense only if it has only one queue to forward the messages.



	
What is Publishing of Message?
	- Producer will send the message to exchange then later exchange will forward the message to Queue.
	
What is Consuming of Messages?
	- Consuming the messages from consumer from queue is Consuming of messages.
